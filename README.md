# Everything Sovol SV08

A place to store the knowledge I have found about the SV08.

Heavily inspired by the work of bassamanator's excellent [everything-sovol-sv06 repo](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06). I could not have been succesful with my SV06 without it.

You can contribute by making a [pull-request](https://github.com/adepssimius/everything-sovol-sv08/pulls), creating an [issue](https://github.com/adepssimius/everything-sovol-sv08/issues), or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/adepssimius/everything-sovol-sv08/discussions).

_None of the links found here are affiliate links._

For now I am using this as an outline to plan and a place to catalog mods that I find.

# Printed Upgrades

## More Printable SV08 Toolhead Cover by Damian Cady
The printhead cover is not well suited to printing. Print your own more easily with this model.

### Available at
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/850271-sovol-sv08-alternative-toolhead-cover)

## BTT 5" HDMI Screen Adapter by Nadir
The screen available from sovol is a bit pricey for what it is. Use this to be able to use a common 3d printer touch screen and have it look like your printer came with it.

## Klicky Probe Mod by Nadir
Using an inductive probe to find your z location can be problematic due to temperature induced error. If you home with a cold probe, you will get a different measurement compared to if the probe has been sitting over a heated bed for a while. A Klicky probe solves that problem by replacing the inductive probe with a physical switch that touches the bed. Klicky probes are typical on Voron 2.4 printers and ensure that you will get repeatable measurements on both a cold start and after hours of printing.

_Further instructions will be added soon, as this is one of the first mods I wil be doing to my SV08._

# Modifications

## Cheaper HDMI Touchscreen
The screen price from sovol is pretty steep. Here's a few HDMI touchscreens that should work just fine. See the [5" HDMI Screen Adapter](#btt-5-hdmi-screen-adapter-by-nadir) as well.
